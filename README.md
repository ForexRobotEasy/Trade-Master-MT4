## Code Explanation

The code is written in MQL4, the programming language used in MetaTrader 4. It consists of several functions that are executed at different stages of the expert advisor's lifecycle.

### Import necessary libraries

The code starts by importing the necessary library, 'Trade.mqh', which provides the functionality for executing trades.

### Define constants

Next, the code defines a constant `MAX_ORDERS` with a value of 100, which represents the maximum number of orders that can be placed by the robot.

### Define global variables

The code defines a global variable `Trade` of type `CTrade`, which is an instance of the `Trade` class from the imported library. This object is used to interact with the trading functionality provided by the platform. Another global variable `TotalOrders` is defined to store the total number of open orders.

### Initialize the expert advisor

The `OnInit` function is executed when the expert advisor is initialized. In this function, the `Trade` object is initialized by calling the `Init` method. The `PositionsTotal` method is then called to get the total number of open orders, which is stored in the `TotalOrders` variable. The function returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate that initialization was successful.

### Execute trading logic

The `OnTick` function is executed on each tick of the market. It first checks if there are any open orders by comparing the `TotalOrders` variable with 0. If there are open orders, it loops through each order and closes it by calling the `PositionClose` method of the `Trade` object.

If there are no open orders, the function enters an else block and places new pending orders. It uses a loop to place `MAX_ORDERS` number of orders. For each order, it calls the `PositionAdd` method of the `Trade` object to place a buy limit order and a sell limit order.

### Deinitialize the expert advisor

The `OnDeinit` function is executed when the expert advisor is deinitialized. In this function, any remaining open orders are cleaned up by looping through each order and calling the `PositionDelete` method of the `Trade` object. Finally, the `Deinit` method is called on the `Trade` object to deinitialize it.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the trading logic and may not represent the complete functionality of the Trade Master MT4 robot.
